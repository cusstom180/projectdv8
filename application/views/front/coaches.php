							<p>I'm an outdoorsy guy who loves to ski, snowboard and mountain bike. When I'm inside I love to do CrossFit. I started CrossFit in the beginning of 2012. In high school I ran track and field and wrestled. I see CrossFit as an escape from your day. When my athletes walk through the door I give them an encouraging environment where they can give it all they got. My favorite cheat meal is Mac and Cheese.</p>

          					<p> Coaching and teaching is what I was meant to do in life. Seeing those athletes do something they thought they would never be able to do makes my heart smile. I'm that person who is proof that you can go from just sitting on a couch everyday and opting out of gym and sports in high school to loving CrossFit so much to go and decide and coach it. I started CrossFit around Labor Day of 2013. I took one step into DV8 and have never left. I graduated from Oakland University in April 2016 with a Bachelors of Science in Elementary Education with minor endorsements in math and science. I love skiing whenever there is snow on the ground and also love playing with my cats.</p>

          					<p>I joined CrossFit Deviate in 2013 with little knowledge of what CrossFit was. I came in on Day 1 confident; I was a lifelong athlete and a natural at most any sport I tried. After 12 minutes with a rower and a slam ball, I found myself lying on my back, gasping for air, wondering what had just happened, and I was instantly in love. In 2015 I got my CrossFit Level 1 Cert and began coaching. In CrossFit I found a passion. When I joined Deviate, I didn’t just join a gym, I joined a community and I made some of the closest friends I have ever had, and they fuel my passion daily. CrossFit is for anyone, because the individuals needs differ by degree, not kind. One of my favorite quotes is “It would be a shame for anyone to grow old without seeing the strength and beauty that their body is capable of.” So for anyone wondering what CrossFit is, come on in, because I’d love to show you.</p>

          					<p>Hi, my name is Chad Strobel. I discovered CrossFit in 2011 while working as a Firefighter/Paramedic. Spending hours per week lifting at my local gym just wasn’t meeting the demands of my career. Having a job where my life depends on “general physical preparedness” stressed to me the importance of functional training. CrossFit not only transformed my athleticism to another level, it introduced me to my newfound passion of training others. I love to dissect athlete’s movement and find ways to increase their performance while decreasing risk of injury. Working with people of all levels and watching them reach their goals is by far one of my greatest rewards. Outside of the gym, I am studying hard to one day become a nurse and continue to work as a hairstylist at Studio Glitz in Lake Orion. Yes, you read that correctly, I am a hairstylist as well.</p>

          					 <p> I started CrossFit in 2011 and now I can’t imagine my life without it. I meet intelligent and inspirational people constantly just by going to the box. I have also met many people through Olympic Weightlifting since I started strictly training my lifts about a year ago. I even qualified to go to University Nationals in 2015. I love my CrossFit world and my USA Weightlifting world, but I especially love that I get to do both in the same box! I am a full time student of Oakland University studying Physical Therapy. I am a rookie wakeboarder, rookie snowboarder, coffee lover, and I tickle seals for fun (there’s a picture to prove it).</p>

          					<p>I started Crossfit in 2014 after running marathons and numerous other shorter races. I had heard about Crossfit and was very curious but way too nervous to try it. After a few months of watching our kids attend Deviate's youth fitness classes and seeing how much they loved it, my husband and I finally worked up our courage to cancel our fitness club membership and join Crossfit Deviate's community. We have never regretted that decision. Crossfit has made me a better person physically and more importantly mentally.  I am constantly amazed watching the athletes around me and what they accomplish every time they walk into Crossfit Deviate. Nothing makes me happier than seeing a person surprise themselves with what they are capable of.  Come join me for a encouraging, challenging, and one of a kind gym experience that will surely change you for the better!</p>

          					<p>God saved me through the sport of Olympic Weightlifting. I've been training for over 8 years, growing physically, mentally, and spiritually through this sport, and I’m very blessed to be able to give back through coaching. I have competed in almost 20 national weightlifting meets, am the Michigan state record holder for the 48 kg weight class in the Junior Division, and was the bronze medalist at the 2011 Junior National Championships. I took the last two years off from competing due to a wrist injury, but I am now getting back in shape to compete again. I have been dabbling into several CrossFit workouts, so I know exactly what kind of athletes I’m working with on a daily basis. I am a firm believer of the saying: “Give a man a fish, and he’ll eat for a day. Teach a man how to fish, and he’ll eat for a lifetime.” My goal is to teach people to develop a coach’s eye, so no one is breaking their backs when a coach isn't around.</p> 
							<p>Outside of being at the gym for 6 hours a day, I am also a full-time employee at Aon (benefits consulting firm). I work virtually (at home) in the Innovative Solutions &amp; Technologies department as a project manager, and when I’m not at work, I am programming weekly workouts for my individual weightlifting athletes. I also have two mini dachshunds; they are the sweetest and would melt your heart if you saw them. </p>

          					<p>My first experience with CrossFit was when I went to a competition to support my boyfriend. I was immediately drawn in by the mixture of community support, and the competitive atmosphere. I started CrossFit soon after in my friend’s garage because they did not have a box in the area, I was hooked. One of my favorite moments from CrossFit was getting my first muscle up; after which I proceeded to sprint a lap around the gym in excitement and give everyone there jumping high-fives.</p>
