			<p>Our classes are designed to provide a lot of teaching and coaching to ensure that our athletes are getting the most out of each class. Each class will focus on building up each athlete’s strength levels while also improving upon their skills and technique.</p>
			  <p>Our WODs (Workout of the Days) are based on each member’s strength and making them “tailor-made” for the individual and their ability level. We believe in programming our WODs for the athletes who aspire to compete at the CrossFit Games™ but knowing that any athlete could perform the WODs to the best of their ability with correct modifications.</p>

			  <i class="fa fa-quote-left left-quote" aria-hidden="true"></i><p class="mb-0"> CrossFit begins with a belief in fitness. The aim of CrossFit is to forge a broad, general and inclusive fitness. We have sought to build a program that will best prepare trainees for any physical contingency — not only for the unknown, but for the unknowable. After looking at all sport and physical tasks collectively, we asked what physical skills and adaptations would most universally lend themselves to performance advantage. Capacity culled from the intersection of all sports demands would quite logically lend itself well to all sport. In sum, our specialty is not specializing.<i class="fa fa-quote-right right-quote" aria-hidden="true"></i></p>

  	      <p>This sport trains your dynamic and explosive strength, using your body’s full range of motion while requiring mental focus as well as good mobility. The two competition lifts, the snatch and clean &amp; jerk, are often incorporated into the CrossFit workouts, and it is essential to learn the proper technique in order to perform safely and effectively especially during the high-intensity workouts.</p>
  	      <p>Our general Olympic Weightlifting development program consists of three classes a week. Each class focuses on drills, progressions, and exercises designed to improve your proficiency in the snatch and clean &amp; jerk. Tuesdays are focused on snatches, Thursdays are focused on clean &amp; jerks, and Sundays are focused on both lifts. The program is designed to accommodate athletes of all skill levels, so you will get a challenging and rewarding experience in every class, regardless of your training background.</p>
